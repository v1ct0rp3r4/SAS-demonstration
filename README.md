The purpose of this GitHub project was to demonstrate the recreation of a select amount of visualizations as seen in the paper 
"Disproportionality Analysis and Characterisation of Medication Errors in EudraVigilance: Exploring Findings on Sexes and Age Groups",
which is publicly available to read. (DOI: 10.1007/s40264-024-01478-6)

The original figures were made with R and recreated/tested in SAS OnDemand for Academics. Feel free to run it on your own version of SAS.

Happy coding!
