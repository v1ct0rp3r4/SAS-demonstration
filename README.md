The purpose of this GitHub project was to demonstrate the recreation of a select amount of visualizations as seen in the paper 
"Disproportionality Analysis and Characterisation of Medication Errors in EudraVigilance: Exploring Findings on Sexes and Age Groups",
which is publicly available to read. (DOI: 10.1007/s40264-024-01478-6)

The original figures were made with R and recreated in SAS OnDemand for Academics (freely available for Academics: https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics.html). Feel free to run the SAS-scripts on your own version of SAS.

Happy coding!
